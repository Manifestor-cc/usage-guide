# Far Cry Games

### 1. Download the bypass files for your desired game
Supported games:
- ~~Far Cry 6~~ (an update broke the fix, you can [download it from SteamRIP](https://steamrip.com/far-cry-6-ultimate-edition-free-download-z1/) for now)
- Far Cry 5
- Far Cry New Dawn
- Far Cry Primal
- Far Cry 4
- Far Cry 3

### 2. Drag the files into the game’s folder
Open the game’s folder (How to open Steam game's folder?), then open the the .zip file you’ve downloaded. Select all of the files and drag them into the game’s folder. When a window like this pops up:

Click **Replace the file in the destination**. It could appear multiple times.

### Congrats!

For some games, you may need to start them directly via the .exe, not trough the Steam Library.
