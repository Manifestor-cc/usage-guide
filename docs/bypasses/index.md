# Bypasses/Fixes
Some games have their own DRM (anti-piracy protection), but luckily we have bypasses for those!

:::danger
We got all of these bypasses from third party sources, we did not make them! Use them cautiously - do not disable your antivirus if it detects something!
:::

:::note
We haven't tested if these work, and we won't be able to help you with them.
:::

If a game's bypass/fix uses the standard installation process (just extracting files into the game directory), you'll find it listed under [Common bypasses/fixes](/bypasses/common_bypasses).

Games that require a unique or specialized installation method have their own dedicated pages (which you'll find below).

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
```
