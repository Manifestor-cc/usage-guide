### 2. Drag the files into the game's folder
Open the game's folder ([How to open Steam game's folder?](/extras/opening_a_steam_games_folder)), then open the the .zip file you've downloaded. Select the folder inside of the .zip file and drag it into the game's folder. When a window like this pops up:

Every time you want to play the game, you have to launch it using the .exe file, not from Steam.
