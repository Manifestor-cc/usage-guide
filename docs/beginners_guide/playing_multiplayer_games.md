# Playing multiplayer games
If you want to play games like Schedule I, R.E.P.O. or others with friends, you have to install an Online Fix.

This will not work for games with matchmaking.

### 1. Open & setup [Online-Fix](https://online-fix.me/)
1. **Open Online-Fix** - https://online-fix.me/
2. **Select your languauge** - The website is Russian. If you don't understand Russian, choose English (or any other languauge you might prefer) in the top right corner.
3. **Register** - You need to register to access any of the download links. Hover over the Register button and choose either Google or Discord.

### 2. Find your game
Find the multiplayer game you want to play.

When you've found your game, scroll down until you see the Download buttons. Click on the **Download from Online-fix Hosters** button, and the download page will open. Select the file that has the following name: `[Game Name]_Fix_Repair_Steam_V[Something]_Generic.rar`

### 3. Download WinRAR
If you haven't already, [download and install WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/postdownload.html)

### 4. Drag the files into the game's folder
Open the game's folder ([How to open Steam game's folder?](/extras/opening_a_steam_games_folder)), then open the the .rar file you've downloaded. The password is `online-fix.me`. Select all of the files inside of the archive and drag them into the game's folder. When a window like this pops up:
