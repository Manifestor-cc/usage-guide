# Playing multiplayer games
If you want to play games like Schedule I, R.E.P.O. or others with friends, you'll have to install an Online Fix.

:::info
This will not work for games with matchmaking. (There are some exceptions though)
:::

### 1. Open & setup [Online-Fix](https://online-fix.me/)
1. **Open Online-Fix** - https://online-fix.me/
2. **Select your languauge** - The website is Russian. If you don't understand Russian, choose English (or any other languauge you might prefer) in the top right corner.
3. **Register** - You need to register to access any of the download links. Hover over the Register button and choose either Google or Discord.

### 2. Find your game
Find the multiplayer game you want to play.

When you've found your game, scroll down until you see the Download buttons. Click on the **Download from Online-fix Hosters** button, and the download page will open. Select the file that has the following name: `[Game Name]_Fix_Repair_Steam_V[Something]_Generic.rar`

### 3. Download WinRAR
If you haven't already, [download and install WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/postdownload.html)

### 4. Drag the files into the game's folder
Open the game's folder ([How to open Steam game's folder?](/extras/opening_a_steam_games_folder)), then open the the .rar file you've downloaded. The password is `online-fix.me`. Select all of the files inside of the archive and drag them into the game's folder. When a window like this pops up:

Click **Replace the file in the destination**. It could appear multiple times.

### Congrats!
If you've followed all of the steps correctly, you should have online working.
