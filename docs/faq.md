<summary>What's Denuvo Anti-Tamper? Can I bypass it?</summary>

> What's Denuvo Anti-Tamper?

Denuvo Anti-Tamper is a DRM (digital rights management) system used in PC games to prevent piracy. It works by encrypting the game's code and constantly checking if it's been modified or cracked. The system requires online verification to confirm you bought the game legitimately.
> Can I bypass it?

There is currently no known public bypass for Denuvo, BUT most game publishers remove Denuvo from their games eventually (because it costs them a lot of money).
