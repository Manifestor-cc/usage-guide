# FAQ

## General
### What's SteamTools?
It’s a tool developed by chinese hackers used for injecting Lua & Manifest files into Steam.

### What are the Manifest & Lua files for?
They are files that contain game license data.

### Can my Steam account get banned?
No. The games you add are fully client-side, so you can't get banned.

### How to fix the “Content Configuration Unavailable” error?
Go to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\appcache` and delete the `appinfo.vdf` file.

## Generator (Manifestor.cc)
### How long does it take for a new game to become available in the generator?
New (popular) games are usually added to the database within 4-9 days.

### What does “Manifest not found” mean? I can’t download my game!
The generator does not have every single game that's available on Steam. There is a database of license data that the generator uses to create the files that SteamTools can inject.

### Can I hide ads from the website?
No, but we’re considering adding a premium plan that would also have some other cool perks

### The generation is taking forever!
That happens when your game you're downloading has a lot of DLC's

### Is Manifestor.cc open-source?
No. The only part of Manifestor.cc that's open-source is the Usage Guide (which you're on right now!)
